The contents of this directory is an example of what is required for creating a test
verification environment.  The files are expected to be in in the test wrapper github
in the following 2 directories
verification_config: contains the file that designates the test, parameters and results location
base_test_results: contains the various test results directories

Option passed to general_setup from the test wrapper: --test_verification <file>

Test verification file
	1) Used to run a series of verification tests
	2) To ensure consistency across all wrappers the accepted format is
	   verification_config/<test_name>_verify
Format of file
Required_Systems: Systems test needs to be executed on
fields: Name of fields in the results file, and type of field.
test:<options>:<directory where to find the results>

Valid field types are
	s string
	sm  string, must match exactly
